The Stu-Mart Project


Stu-Mart provides a web-based portal to buy-sell-borrow resources. This contributes immensely to the reusability and availability of the products. The project intends to provide links to the soft content related to subjects or soft copies of notes. Another feature the project would like to include is to allow retailers or fellow students to showcase their products on our website. 

A student can then obtain all the resources at a relatively lower cost and relatively less effort without having to search for it, and hence using his time in much more efficient manner. The highlight of this project is that it facilitates an integration with the Moodle of the specific organization to provide the student with materials provided by the organizations like assignments, college content, or any other circular. This system will also help to improve the communication between seniors and juniors, and provide proper guidance from the seniors to use the resources efficiently. 

A student would get his own personal account where he can manage his education and gather resources categorically according to subjects. A student would be notified through SMS and email in the advent of any new event on the Moodle.
